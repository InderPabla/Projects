Resource Components
- An Arduino microprocessor to control the overall inputs given to the radio transmitter
- A radio transmitter to give signals to the radio receiver.  
- A radio receiver to get receive signals from the transmitter and activate the motors.
- One motor to move the front wheels left or right once it is given power from the radio receiver.
- One motor to move the back wheels forward or backwards once it is given power from the radio receiver.

Power Components
- One 9V battery to power the radio transmitter.
- Four AA 1.5V batteries to power the RC car’s two motors and one radio receiver.
- One A/B USB cable to connect Arduino to a computer

Block Diagram: 
The Arduino is interfaced with the radio transmitter which sends signals to the radio receiver commanding the RC Car’s motors to either go forward, reverse or stop. This is accomplished by using a java program to send simple string messages to the Arduino which invokes certain commands in the radio transmitter. The differing states of the four digital pins (2, 4, 6, 8) determines these commands which include forward, left, right, and reverse. That command is then sent to the radio receiver which controls the motors moving the car.

This flowchart explains the user interaction with the system. When the user clicks one of the GUI buttons, an action is started. This action can be any of the actions generated by a GUI.  Once an action is started it leads to method call which sends Arduino a special string that is an integer number.  Inside the Arduino, a serial check is always running and checking if there is any available data. When the Arduino serial detects information, it is then read into a char variable. If the char variable is matched to a certain char integer then two pins are affected. The char can range from 0 to 5.
  -Char 0: pin 2 is set to High and pin 4 is set to High, causing the car’s back wheels to stop rotating.
  
  -Char 1: pin 2 is set to Low and pin 4 is set to High, causing the car’s back wheels to rotate backwards. 
  
  -Char 2: pin 2 is set to High and pin 4 is set to Low, causing the car’s back wheels to rotate forwards.
  
  -Char 3: pin 6 is set to High and pin 8 is set to High, causing the car’s front to reset to middle.
  
  -Char 4: pin 6 is set to Low and pin 8 is set to High, causing the car’s front wheels turn to the left. 
  
  -Char 5: pin 6 is set to High and pin 8 is set to Low, causing the car’s front wheels turn to the right.
